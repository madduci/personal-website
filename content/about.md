### Contents of this blog

These Web pages contain thoughts and references about my interests: Project Management, Distributed Systems, Software Architecture, DevOps and Software Development.

I enjoy to share my researches with others who might encounter problems I've already solved or for which I've found a potential solution, avoiding the classic _reinventing the wheel_, in pure engineering way.

I'm open to feedbacks and discussions on published themes and to critics which can help improving this blog.
